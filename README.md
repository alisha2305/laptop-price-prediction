#Laptop Price Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict the price of a laptop based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, GPU, and other specifications. The model is built using machine learning techniques and can help users estimate laptop prices before making a purchase decision.

Features :

Dataset preprocessing and cleaning

Feature selection and engineering

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Predictive analysis using trained models

Interactive user interface (if applicable)

Technologies Used ::

Python

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

Flask / Streamlit (for web-based deployment, if applicable)

Installation : 

Clone the repository:
https://github.com/alisha2305/laptop-price-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd laptop-price-prediction

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset :

The dataset used in this project consists of laptop specifications and their corresponding prices.

Usage :

Prepare and preprocess the dataset.

Train the machine learning model using the training data.

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

Use the trained model to predict laptop prices.

(Optional) Deploy the model using a web framework.

To run the model:

python main.py

Model Training

The following steps are involved in training the model:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering 

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Choosing the best model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decission tree, etc.)

Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared

Deployment :

The model can be deployed using Flask or Streamlit for a simple web interface. If deploying with Flask:

python app.py

For Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py
